Part 0: How to R

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/


Let's start with the layout: source, console, environment, files.

Let's try some stuff in the console:

1 / 200 * 30

(59 + 73 + 2) / 3

sin(pi / 2)

Let's assign some variables

x <- 100

y <- 1:100

snake_case <- "An easy way to store variable names in R. All lowercase letters with underscores for spaces. You can put numbers on the end if you want"

Functions

mean()

rnorm()

## R Markdown

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

What happened?
If you try to load a package and you can't, it probably means it's not installed. We can install a package using install.packages('somePackage'). Try typing the code to install the package 'tidyverse' in the chunk below and running the chunk.

```{r}
# remember that you don't need to install packages more than once
```


```{r}
airbnb <- read_csv('data/airbnb.csv')
```

Notice that you now have a new variable in your environment pane.

What did this code just do?

Now let's make a new code chunk. You can either type out ``` using the key above 'tab', then {r} or use the handy shortcut 'command + option + i' on mac or 'control + alt + i' on linux or windows. In the new chunk, use View() to look at the airbnb.



## Part 1: Different data formats, data structures

Questions: 

1.1. What different types of data do you see in the airbnb data set? How do you think these data were collected by Airbnb? How did they come to us? Is this big-data based on the definition we've used in lecture?

1.2. Run the following code chunk and then view the resulting variables by typing their names into the console.

```{r}
var1 <- mean(airbnb$host_listings_count, na.rm = TRUE)
var2 <- unique(airbnb$neighbourhood_cleansed)
var3 <- airbnb %>% select(latitude,longitude)
```

1.3. What are the differences between var1, var2, and var3 in terms of the kind of data and the format or structure it's stored in?

1.4. It's not a good idea to call things 'var1' or 'var2.' Based on what is stored by those variables, rename them using snake_case.

Bonus 1.1: What's the most common type of data in airbnb?

Bonus 1.2: Plot latitude and longitude, more bonus: use 'neighborhood' as the color most bonus: put it on a map


## Part 2: Introduction to the R environment, Variables, Functions, Data Types

Questions:

2.1 What variables have we seen already?

2.2 What functions have we seen already?

2.3 Use the function 'class()' to check the data type of the three variables from part 1.

DataFrames are key, we'll use them a lot. DataFrames are special lists of lists where each of the lists has the same length, these are the columns. Each column contains a specific kind of data. A row is the value in each column for a particular index level. 

We can get specific columns from a dataframe by using a $:

airbnb$room_type

Colums are lists, so you can find a specific index by using []:

airbnb$room_type[30]

You can use the function head(n) to get the top n values of a dataframe or list

'room_type' has a few different values. We can use the function unique() to find the different values.

unique(airbnb$room_type)

Try running each line of the code chunk below by putting your cursor on the line and pressing 'command' + 'return' on mac and 'ctl'+'return' on windows or linux.

```{r}
airbnb$room_type
airbnb$room_type[30]
head(airbnb$room_type)
unique(airbnb$room_type)
```


## 3 Some More About Functions
We can think about R functions as verbs, and Data and values as nouns. All R functions have the following form:

functionName(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2)

You can see help information about any function by using the help() function, like

help('setwd') 

BUT there's a shortcut:

?setwd

OR if you're not sure of the name of the function:

??select

If none of that helps, remember the secret to coding: google and stackexchange


## 4 Practice Exercises

4.1 Make a new code chunk and use it to look at the column names of airbnb using the function colnames
```{r}
colnames(airbnb)
```

4.2 Use the unique function to list the types of properties available (not the room types)

```{r}
unique(airbnb$property_type)
```


4.3 find the average number of days that a property is available over the next year. You'll need to find the right variable, then the right function to use, then apply that fuction to that variable.

```{r}
mean(airbnb$availability_365, na.rm = TRUE)
```


Bonus 4.1: How many hosts are superhosts?



Bonus 4.2: What's the average price of a unit?

WHY WILLIAMSBURG?

Williamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself.","within an hour","100%","N/A","f","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/15991/profile_pic/1259104907/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/15991/profile_pic/1259104907/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Williamsburg",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']","t","f","Brooklyn, NY, United States","Williamsburg","Williamsburg","Brooklyn","Brooklyn","NY","11211","New York","Brooklyn, NY","US","United States",40.7083719866839,-73.9535186885434,"t","Apartment","Entire home/apt",3,1,NA,1,"Real Bed","{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50""}",500,"$140.00",NA,NA,"$200.00","$90.00",2,"$20.00",2,90,"today","t",2,20,35,281,2018-03-04,86,2009-05-25,2018-02-25,90,9,10,10,10,9,9,"f",NA,NA,"f","f","strict","f","f",1,0.8,58603,3050,3408,23514,90117

We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them.

A few adjectives that accurately describe me are: worldly, easy-going, authentic, bold and courageous.  I love to travel and share my love of culture and language with others. Photography is also a  love of mine and all the pictures in the apartment were taken by me during my travels around the world.  I like to cook from time to time and airports and beaches excite me; there is something about all the hustle and bustle of being in a busy airport that just makes me want to go far away.

In 1980 he joined the Escola de Música de Brasília (EMB), where he was selected to participate in the children's choir that performed on the first Opera seasons of Brasília. At 14 years of age, after a pause from his studies at the EMB, Leonardo started playing electric-bass, having performed with various rock bands of his home town. In 1987, he returned to the EMB where, for the first time, he was exposed to an acoustic-bass. In 1989, during an exchange program to Canada, Leonardo participated in a jazz festival and won a scholarship to study at Berklee College of Music. In 1991, he moved to Boston, where, in 1995, he graduated from Berklee with a degree in Professional Music. In 1995, he formed Quizamba Music a production company dedicated to contemporary Brazilian music. That same year, he formed the Brazilian Jazz-Funk group Zabumbatuq and produced their first CD through Quizamba Music just prior to organizing the group's Swiss tour. Between 1996 and 1998 while in Boston, he produced and participated in various recordings including the sound track to the motion picture Next Stop Wonderland. In 1998 after working extensively in the Boston music scene with his group as well as with the finest musicians in that area, Leonardo enrolled at Emerson College from where he graduated in 2001 with a Masters in Visual and Media Arts. While at Emerson he acted as Jazz coordinator for WERS 88.9 FM where he also hosted a weekly Brazilian Music radio show called Terra Brasilis. In 1999 with his Masters not yet completed, he was hired by Volatile Media in New York City, where he moved, to create the latin/world and jazz/blues catalogs for the custom compilation CD website, (Website hidden by Airbnb) In 2001 Leonardo left Volatile Media, graduated from Emerson College and returned to music full time. Leonardo then re-established Quizamba as a Contemporary Brazilian Jazz group with whom he performs regularly in the New York area. For the past two years Leonardo has also perfromed with numerous A list musicians such as Jimmy Cobb, Duduka Da Fonseca, Maucha Adnet, Hendrik Meurkens, Dave Pietro, Chiara Civello, Alain Mallet, Helio Alves, Guilherme Monteiro and 
Anat Cohen to name a few.

The apartment is a rare gem amongst the many shoeboxes of NYC. I love it and have put a lot of work into it and want to share it with like minded down to earth people. My sister and I are super chill and very accommodating hosts and we expect to be treated the same way. Aggressive, rude and unreasonable behaviour from any guests won't be accepted.  By renting it to you I expect that you understand this and to please treat my place as if it was your own.","Apartment is walking distance to 123, NQR, ACE and 456 train lines all which can connect you to to basically any part of the city.  Cabs are always available from the street at anytime too.","Access to the whole apartment except for the 1 small storage closet next to the bedrooms.","My sister helps me out giving keys over and greeting the guests, she tries to be able to be there for all the guests, however, if its a super late/early check in, a weekend, or if she is out of town we will leave the key at a key locker at a deli a few minutes away from the apartment. Her interaction will be very minimal i.e greeting you and then she will be out of your hair.  She is also happy to answer any questions you have about the apt via phonecall/text.","Please respect the apartment and our neighbours, ok to have friends over but no loud and messy parties. Also please  turn central air off while no one is in the apt  PLEASE put all your trash in the trash can and take it out before before leaving the premises.

After disabling my Airbnb account for nearly 4 years, I have decided to return. My decision to leave Airbnb was based on a horrible experience with my last guests who damaged my apartment and were dishonest with their booking and post-review. I had so many positive experiences that I decided the good outweighs the bad.

I am happy to be back offering my beautiful and clean, New York City brownstone apartment to the global Airbnb community.

ABOUT ME:

I'm a southern gentleman who likes to entertain. I enjoy wining and dining, but cooking is fun as well. I get out to the theater or happy hour when I can. Otherwise, I enjoy a quiet night at home with my partner. We have invested a lot in our home and am sure that you will feel that it is truly a home away from home.

I own a small hospitality consulting firm. I have a background in media advertising as well as music/entertainment. My partner is from Los Angeles and also works in the hospitality industry.

We are honest, sincere and easy to get along with. We speak English and Spanish!

There are all the restaurants (La Esquina, Balthazar, Lovely Day, Cafe Henrie, Dimes, de Maria, Bacaro, Freemans, Essex...the list is really too long), boutiques (anything you can think of) and nightlife (Bowery Ballroom, the Box, Bowery Hotel, Crosby Bar, Gold Bar, Milk & Honey, etc...), basically anything you could ask for. There are also a growing number of galleries in the area alongside the New Museum. Close to gyms such as Equinox and NY Sports, the best yoga studios (Sky Ting and Y7), Whole Foods for marketing, and one of the best movie theatres, Sunshine Cinema and the new Metrograph, a cinema","Stairs: Although it is noted in the description, I would like to reiterate that this is a 4th floor walk up.

I am a working mother and artist who lives in one of the best neighborhoods in New York City with my teenaged son, Idriys, and our adorable toy poodle, Chester.  We have been offering our properties since 2010 in NYC and since 2013 in Washington DC. I manage the property in DC for my big sister, Khadijah, who is an attorney and interior designer. She lives in the attached house there. While I will handle all of your arrangements beforehand, I am based in NYC. Upon arrival, Khadijah will be your host in Washington DC.

In NYC, you will meet me, Idriys, and Chester. I am an actor/writer/director who is now beginning to study music. My son, Idriys, is my favorite thing. He loves art, sports, literature and music and is extremely good with small children (and animals) if you ever need a babysitter. We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them. What a wonderful way to make a living by providing a peaceful environment, good energy, and a home away from home to people during their travels.

ABOUT ME:

I'm a southern gentleman who likes to entertain. I enjoy wining and dining, but cooking is fun as well. I get out to the theater or happy hour when I can. Otherwise, I enjoy a quiet night at home with my partner. We have invested a lot in our home and am sure that you will feel that it is truly a home away from home.

I own a small hospitality consulting firm. I have a background in media advertising as well as music/entertainment. My partner is from Los Angeles and also works in the hospitality industry.

We founded our organization, Project Harmony, Inc., almost 30  years ago, and we maintain the small garden-park aross the street from our “brownstone.”  We acquired our “brownstone” in  1996.

We enjoy meeting interesting, creative and passionate people from around the world and sharing our love of Brooklyn and New York City with them -- the history, food, art, architecture, and music. What we offer is a room in a beautiful house. We are relaxed and welcoming. We ask that our guests make themselves at home (and we do all we can to make them as comfortable as possible). Staying with us is like staying with friends or family (who can cook well). We do not have locks on room doors (although we do fully respect our guest's privacy). This is not a hotel or a bed and breakfast ""business"" (no teddy bears or pot pourri). It is sometimes elegant and sometimes casual. We like vintage furniture, street art, local food, and all kinds of music ...  an urban sensibility. It's 'real life' in this house -- we have dogs who are enthusiastic greeters, teenagers who are in and out and friends who stop by. That said, we try really hard to make each guest's stay wonderfully memorable. Please read our reviews. We have had amazing guests!

I'm a southern California native who's lived in New York for just over 8 years and can honestly say that not even the coldest of winters has made me miss my west coast roots!  Running is one of my passions and I am fortunate to live near the Hudson River and next to one of the most beautiful and tranquil parks in NYC - Riverside Park.

I am a former restaurateur who currently works in hospitality and have always loved entertaining and sharing my homes with others.  The apartment is owned by myself and the walls are adorned with original artwork by a local NYC artist.  It is my primary residence so the apartment contains most of my personal effects, yet carefully hidden, so you're not surrounded by my 'stuff'.  My hope is to find like-minded people who are respectful but will enjoy the warm and inviting atmosphere I've tried to create to its fullest. 

Please don't hesitate to ask me additional questions about the apartment or specific inquiries/needs you may have that I failed to address in the description. I hope you get the opportunity and have the desire to  experience my little oasis for yourself.

I am not surprised that these young women didn't like the fact that I asked them accountable for their actions and simply clean up after themselves.

I am a Brazilian student living in ... (unimaginable? exciting? stressful? contagious? ...) New York City. It is very difficult to define an adjective that fits perfectly with what I feel for this city. every day is a new experience, new feelings, new discoveries, and I think I will never have an only adjective to express what I feel for New York.
I was born and raised in Porto Alegre, a city in Southern Brazil. At 19, I moved to Rio de Janeiro, my city in the world. Since child I always wanted to live in Rio de Janeiro, always loved the ocean, to be near this. And I live  that in Rio de Janeiro. Go to the beach after work, go bathe in the ocean at night after class .. The Rio de Janeiro is a city that makes you feel alive, gives you energy, makes you cry with emotion when you see the natural beauty it has.
I never thought of moving from Rio de Janeiro, and even today I know it's my place, but I was 27, and felt a need to live new exeperiencia, seeing different places, different cultures, and I changed my whole life and I came to the Big Apple.
The life here is not easy, it is very hard you get your space, it is very hard you leave the margins of society, you enter in the ""system"" of the city, but each day of fighting is rewarding.
At 1 year and 7 months that I live in NYC, I've seen many people pass through the city, stay a while, but 99% of people don't stand the pressure which is living, or rather survive here. And I think the phrase that defines New York City is: ""It is not you who chooses New York, It  is New York that chooses you.""","within an hour","100%","N/A","f","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/75b41555-305b-47b5-bee6-4bd533bc0f82.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/75b41555-305b-47b5-bee6-4bd533bc0f82.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","East Harlem",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']","t","t","New York, NY, United States","East Harlem","East Harlem","Manhattan","New York","NY","10029","New York","New York, NY","US","United States",40.7910661246656,-73.9438083677356,"t","Apartment","Private room",2,1,1,2,"Real Bed","{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",Heating,""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50""}",194,"$86.00",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"$20.00",3,120,"2 days ago","t",10,19,30,305,2018-03-04,183,2012-03-26,2018-01-03,94,10,10,10,10,8,9,"f",NA,NA,"f","f","strict","f","f",1,2.53,10119,19344,5097,39859,76003

I have lived in New York City all my life, and have lived at my current place for two years.. I am a student in Environmental Science and play music in two bands around Brooklyn, one for children (for example birthday parties for 5 year olds) and one rock and roll band, but I don't drink or smoke (don't mind other people who do)... I read alot of books and listen to alot of radio shows about science and international news- I ride my bike everywhere. If you stay at my house I will try and find you a bike!

I've travelled a little bit, to Europe (Sweden, Slovenia, Spain, France, Holland, Belgium, Germany), and to Mexico (D.F. mostly) and Israel but haven't left ny in the past few years. 
In the summer I try to go to the beach as much as possible. In the winter I visit friend's houses and drink tea. One day I would like to visit Africa, South America, the Artic and Papua New Guinea, (if I can ever save the money for the airline ticket :)  )
I can't live without books, friends, going for a walk once a day, trying to learn other languages (speak spanish, working on french, have taken classes in Greek, Japanese, Hebrew and Portuguese), and my family (they live in San Francisco)..

Our house is medium sized, but it has plenty of space for privacy, if you need your space after a long trip-  or for hanging out- we have a projector sometimes watch movies or listen to records in the living room- As far as hosting goes, I love New York and have many friends involved in all sides of it, from the arts/ music scenes to restaurants to activism- I know most neighborhoods in the city pretty well and am always happy to give people advice on where to go and what to do so they don't just see the stuff everyone sees.

NYC is so easily accessible from my home. It is a short walk to the train station and within 20 minutes you are in the heart of mid-town Manhattan. You can enjoy all the excitement and insanity of the city and come home and sleep in a quiet, comfortable, safe  bed.

If you are driving here from someplace there is also plenty of free parking on the street.

The neighborhood still has a  very ""real Brooklyn"" vibe--it is the last neighborhood on the park to remain so culturally diverse.

Originaire du Québec, on m'a un jour arrachée à ma ville adorée, Montréal, pour me déposer au beau milieu de Brooklyn, métropole à la fois hétéroclite, charmante, trépidante et poétique.

I am Greek, born in Germany, raised up in Greece, studied in France, the UK, India and South America and have been calling Manhattan, New York my home since 1997. 

I am an animal, human and environmental rights activist, yoga teacher, film producer and the founder of 2 NGO organizations. Feel free to ask me for more details if you take interest in any of this :) 

My yoga teacher once said: ""When you eat meat, you automatically adopt the fear, anxiety, depression, sadness and suffering that the animals were feeling when they were being slaughtered.""

Since then I turned vegan and started becoming active in raising awareness about how toxic the world's Food and Pharmaceutical Industries are. Big corporations like Pepsi, Coca Cola, Nestle, L'Oreal and other, abuse and extinguish nature, water and animals, add toxic ingredients and then make billion dollar profits to the expense of Mother Nature, humans and animals.

Its proximity to the more commercial areas of Fort Greene, Prospect Heights and Park Slope make it a convenient place to stay and we enjoy the relative peace it affords us from the bustle of the city!      The architecture is a mix of wood-frame houses predating the Civil War, Italianate mansions, carriage houses, brownstones, midrise apartment buildings and three- to five-story brick rowhouses. Some are scrupulously restored while others are shedding paint.      Clinton Avenue is the neighborhood’s grandest boulevard, named in honor of DeWitt Clinton, a former governor and mayor.

Travel:
I have traveled to many parts of the world, including Europe (Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France and a bit of Portugal); Latin America (Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica and Columbia); North America (Throughout the United States and Canada – Montreal & Vancouver).  However, I felt the deepest connection to the land, history and people in Mexico (Mexico City, Puebla, Taxco and the Yucatán region). 
I would love to travel to parts of Asia and Africa.

What is it like to have me as a host?
I have been told that I am definitely not boring and am a good conversationalist.  I believe in the benefits of independent exploration as a traveler.  That is the mode I like to travel in and I deeply admire those with similar sensibilities.  Ultimately, it extends to the exploration of the self.  

One of my mottos:
When people ask me, “How are you?”.  I usually say emphatically, “Fantastic!”, if it’s true or not, it always makes me chuckle.  I’m known to be a fan of sarcasm and I like to laugh.

For tourists: The L connects to virtually all train lines in Manhattan, for example, it will only take you about 5-10 minutes longer (including waiting time) to arrive at Time Square once you are at Union Square.  The ride from Morgan Ave to Union Square is about 13 minutes. Trains come very frequently during the day (less than a 5 minute wait usually), and every 20 minutes at night. The Central Ave M train is an 8 minute walk away, and the Myrtle Ave J 11 minutes. This is perfect is you need to go into the Lower East Side, otherwise I would suggest use the L. On the weekend, always walk to Myrtle Ave, not to Central Ave. Look up (Website hidden by Airbnb) if you want to get around, they have the best up to date travel schedules.

I've been in New York for three years now and still absolutely love this city (and the home I've made here).

Unfortunately, I don't get to enjoy it as much as I would like to because I travel quite a bit for work, and would love to give others the opportunity to enjoy my place while I'm gone.

About me: I'm Canadian/Iranian from Toronto. I'm a global events producer, and I love to travel (which works out quite well for me given my work travel schedule). I'm a big sports fan, and I love talking global affairs.

I love new countries, new cultures, new languages. I also love to laugh, a lot: ""A day without laughter is a day wasted"".

This is a very real NYC neighborhood. I have lived here with my children for 6 years, take my dog for walks/go jogging in my neighborhood late at night and have never felt like I was in danger.

It's inspiringly diverse, a true NYC / Brooklyn experience with people from all over the world; one of the things we love is seeing everyone, regardless of culture/background, come together at our corner of the Park for the beautiful nature and peaceful recreation with friends and family.  Prospect Park is 526 acres and was designed by the same people who designed Central Park, and we're right next to the new $74m Lakeside renovation, which is stunningly beautiful.  There's a lot of great food here - Thai, Jamaican, vegetarian, Japanese, Indian, Italian, American, Mexican, Caribbean...  There are tons of groceries close by including an all-organic grocery; there's a great Laundromat with wash 'n' fold around the corner; and there are plenty of convenient shops close by for most everything you might need.  Also, there are some really great coffeeshops in the neighborhood, as well as new gyms (Blink Fitness) and yoga centers.  We're also just a five-minute ride",NA,"The public transportation here is extremely convenient!  As mentioned, the Q and B are super close (Parkside / Church Ave stops), and the F/G is exactly a one mile walk; sometimes we'll just walk instead of going into Manhattan to transfer.  We may have a great bicycle you can use for a longer-term stay (inquire personally).  If you want to bring your car, you can park it on the street, but it can be tricky to find a spot, and you have to move it often for street cleaning.  If you really want to bring your car, I can give you my advice/tips as I street-parked for six months when I first moved here.  In general, though, we recommend public transportation here as it's so convenient.","You'll have access to your huge guest room and the common areas including the kitchen, shared bathroom, and dining/living room (but please let us know in advance if you'd like to really ""use"" the living room, thanks!).

Williamsburg is typically know for: outdoor festivals, live music, art, vintage stores, new designers, cutting edge food, rooftop parties, fashion, bike culture, hipsters, interior design, and my favorite part about Brooklyn: a friendly neighborhood community. We are in Williamsburg proper here at Bedford Ave, not just a nearby subway stop to it or a far walk away. The waterfront area is the most desirable part of Williamsburg, and Bedford ave is the main street. Everything is close, and neighborhood is safe. There are people out and about all day/night hitting the nearby restaurants and bars. This is the first subway stop in Brooklyn from Manhattan, and the first Brooklyn neighborhood right off the bridge.","Please don't lose our key because we will have to charge you the cost of replacing the lock at $90. We take security in the building very seriously : there is video outside of the building that surveys the area for strangers, video intercom, an alarm directly linked to the police station, etc. There is another video in the hallway linked up to an alarm. We are all set up here even though it's a very safe neighborhood in a community that looks out for each other. The neighbors are all wonderful.

As long as you use these common areas and items with respect, we are cool.  Kitchen has a dishwasher and you are welcome to use our cooking tools and wine glasses and all.

We have french press for coffee, but do note that the coffee culture here is huge and there are dozens of incredible coffee shops within a few short blocks. We love hosting new people and having guests back again. You are most welcome to make yourself at home here. I am presently putting together a mega-book that is a guide to all my favorite places in Brooklyn and Manhattan. I also made a small subway map that I'll give you when you arrive. I can set you up with recommendations or an itinerary of things to do nearby if you like. I love showing off my neighborhood.

The most I have lived anywhere is in The Netherlands, followed by the USA.

I'm quite active, and depending on which project I am working on , you may see me a lot, or not.
I like being highly social but I also don't mind not so much contact, so it's mostly up to you the guest how much or how little contact you want. 

If you need or want anything , just ask, if i can, I'll do it for you, so it never hurts to ask.

As a host I don't cancel unless there is a catastrophic situation, and in that case I'll contact you before hand so we can find a solution that works for you.

I love life including its challenges which are really teachers that help us grow and become the best version of ourselves. 

I am Greek, born in Germany, raised up in Greece, studied in France, the UK, India and South America and have been calling Manhattan, New York my home since 1997. 

I am an animal, human and environmental rights activist, yoga teacher, film producer and the founder of 2 NGO organizations. Feel free to ask me for more details if you take interest in any of this :) 

My yoga teacher once said: ""When you eat meat, you automatically adopt the fear, anxiety, depression, sadness and suffering that the animals were feeling when they were being slaughtered.""

Since then I turned vegan and started becoming active in raising awareness about how toxic the world's Food and Pharmaceutical Industries are. Big corporations like Pepsi, Coca Cola, Nestle, L'Oreal and other, abuse and extinguish nature, water and animals, add toxic ingredients and then make billion dollar profits to the expense of Mother Nature, humans and animals. It is my hope to aspire many humans to make a shift towards a more peaceful earth and healthy life :)

I'm a global citizen coming from a mixed background. Easy to get along with, I'm flexible and independent. 
I've travelled and lived in different places in Europe, Africa and the USA.
Italy's Tuscany region (Florence) being my favorite vacation destination. I also love Capetown in South Africa where I went on a Safari and saw the Big 5 (Rhino, Buffalo, Elephant, Leopard and Lion). 

I speak fluently English and French, got to learn at an early age Italian and started speaking Spanish a couple of years ago. 

I dine out a lot and I'm always curious to discover ethnic styles of cooking. I'll never say no to Italian or Indian food ! 

I'm addicted to NYC's indescribable energy and fast paced life. In love with my neighborhood Williamsburg since the 1st time I visited I will be glad to share and show around the magic of this up and coming neighborhood. 

I'm a welcoming, laid back, organized, helpful and respectful host and I've been hosting for over 4 years. Barely home, the apartment will feel just like yours. I expect guests to be clean and respectful of the overall apartment but most of all to be friendly and trustworthy.

I work in Advertising. I am also a Yoga Teacher and Reiki practitioner.

I'm a global citizen coming from a mixed background. Easy to get along with, I'm flexible and independent. 
I've travelled and lived in different places in Europe, Africa and the USA.
Italy's Tuscany region (Florence) being my favorite vacation destination. I also love Capetown in South Africa where I went on a Safari and saw the Big 5 (Rhino, Buffalo, Elephant, Leopard and Lion). 

I speak fluently English and French, got to learn at an early age Italian and started speaking Spanish a couple of years ago. 

I dine out a lot and I'm always curious to discover ethnic styles of cooking. I'll never say no to Italian or Indian food ! 

I'm addicted to NYC's indescribable energy and fast paced life. In love with my neighborhood Williamsburg since the 1st time I visited I will be glad to share and show around the magic of this up and coming neighborhood. 

I'm a welcoming, laid back, organized, helpful and respectful host and I've been hosting for over 4 years. Barely home, the apartment will feel just like yours. I expect guests to be clean and respectful of the overall apartment but most of all to be friendly and trustworthy.
